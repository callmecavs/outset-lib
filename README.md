# outset-lib

[![outset-lib on NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/outset-lib.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/outset-lib)

A boilerplate for ES6 libraries.

## About

Contributing a library to the JS community should be painless, though the current state of the language itself makes it a bit tedious. Allowing creators to use the niceties of ES6, while enabling users to consume the library however they prefer, creates overhead in the process of making and distributing code.

This boilerplate aims to provide an unopinionated solution to this problem.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install outset-lib -g
```

## Use

In your terminal:

```bash
$ outset-lib <name>
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

In your browser:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

Work in the `src` folder. Distribute from the `dist` folder.

## Docs

* **Creators**: Write in ES6/7 syntax via [Babel.js](https://babeljs.io/), and bundle modules via [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)
* **Users**: Enjoy distribution files transpiled down to ES5, and wrapped in a UMD wrapper
